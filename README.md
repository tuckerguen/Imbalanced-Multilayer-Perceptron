# Imbalanced-Multilayer-Perceptron
An implementation of a cost sensitive multilayer perceptron for binary classification in imbalanced datasets. Based on a [research paper by Cristiano L. Castro and Antônio P. Braga](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6469237)  

Additionally attempts to improve the likelihood of convergence through repition of optimization near local optima in previous optimization runs. 

This was part of a final project for a Machine Learning course which is why the MLP is implemented by hand. This would be a really simple project in Tensorflow. 

# K-SMOTE
An implementation of the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) algorithm with an extension that applies the SMOTE algorithm multiple times over clusters identified by K-means in order to better maintain nonlinear input to output relationships in the data.
